# User Guide

## **Starting Up**

### **Server**

First you will need to install Nodejs, which is what the server is built in. To do this go to https://nodejs.org/en/, download Nodejs and then install the file.
To start the server, open up a terminal in the location of the server files (also the location of this user guide). Then run the following commands:

        npm install

        npm start

You should see a message indicating that the server is running.

### **Website**
Once the server is running, open up an internet browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Firefox - Internet Explorer is NOT supported), and type localhost:3000 in the address bar. This will now display the Changing Lives App Manager website.

## **Usage**

### **Manager Website**
The website is used to manage the users of the app and edit the content of the app. 

#### A new user
If somebody new seeks help from Changing Lives, they can be assigned to a member of staff. This staff member then simply needs to log in to the website using their details and click on the USERS tab in the blue bar near the top. This opens the user management display. From here the new user button can be clicked to easily add a new user with no details required apart from a nickname. This could be the users actual name or otherwise, it is just so that members of staff can tell who's who as all usernames are anonymous. This nickname is never shown in the app. Then once OK is clicked, the new user details are shown which can then be given to the user who is now a part of the Changing Lives app.

#### Editing and removing a user
While usernames cannot be changed (this is to keep them anonymous), it is easy to change a user's nickname from here by pressing the edit button next to their name. If someonehas forgotten their password. The procedurce is to contanct their staff member at Changing Lives. The staff member can then click 'edit' next to he user's name and reset the password. A temporary password is provided which can then be given to the user. A user can also be removed by the remove button beside it, for instance if they stop requiring Changing Lives' services.

As the list of users grows, the search bar at the top allows you to more easily find the correct user by searching both nickname and username.

#### Changing the app content
The CONTENT tab allows staff members to change what information is shown to users on the app. A list of the app sections is displayed, and they can be edited and removed similarly to the users. They can also be reordered by the 'move up/down' buttons. This allows staff to prioritise certain sections which are more important.

Creating a new section is a easy as pressing the new section button and filling in the details. All sections have a title, and then there is room for some specific text about the topic which will be useful to the users of the app. We recommend possibly using this to have a daily tip for some sections as it is easy to change later. Below this is where files can be added. The website only accepts PDFs (see the appendix on converting word documents to PDF). Click browse to open up your file browser, allowing you to select one or more files. Then click 'add' to add them. They should appear below and they can be renamed to a useful name to display to users. Then click OK to submit the section.

#### Reviewing the logs
The LOGS tab shows a list of all actions which are taken on the website and app. This can be used for security in the event of someone unwanted getting access to a staff account. It is easy to see exactly what each account did. A more important feature is the restore feature. If a member of staff accidentally deletes something (e.g. a section or a user), then all they have to do to bring it back is to find the action in the logs and click on it. Then some more information will appear. Click restore to have the item brought back.

## **Appendix**

### **Converting a word document to a PDF**

For security and ease of use reasons, the Changing Lives App Manager website only allows file uploads of the type PDF. As most of the Changing Lives documents are Word documents, this will guide you through converting them to PDFs.

1. Open the document in Microsoft Word
2. Click File, then Export
3. Click Create PDF document

This guide was written for the Office 365 version of Word, but should follow similarily for other versions.
